Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease)
 includes numerous problems, many of which are related to a process called atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the
walls of the arteries.

 This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through.
 
If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow.
 
This can cause a heart attack or stroke.

A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot.

 If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle
 supplied by that artery begins to die.

Most people survive their first heart attack and return to their normal lives, enjoying many
 more years of productive activity.
 
But experiencing a heart attack does mean that you need to make some changes.

The medications and lifestyle changes that your doctor recommends may vary according to
 how badly your heart was damaged, and to what degree of heart disease caused the heart attack.
